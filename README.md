# airport_board
Show as split-flap real departure and arrival from Zurich Airport in Switzerland

I found a lot of creative people here and over the web world and with intensive times I decided to use some codes who are not licecend and create with very many patients and learnings this board
The "father/mother" of this board is the Solari Traffic Board who gives me ideas , some of stackoverflow articels and the creator of some python programes, who parsed switzerland airports to a table.

this project was originally forked from [baspete/Split-Flap](https://github.com/baspete/Split-Flap) and heavily modified for the purposes of modernization, flexibility, and other general improvements. and a lot of different viarants, find on Github.

and from Simon Bukhardt on https://github.com/mnemocron

Download and run the exe files for departure and arrival, and you see mostly the actual dep and arr board. I implemented a lot of free logos and some codes to use the json response from the free url.

 
its the web API for ZRH/LSZH ZÃ¼rich Airport Airport arrivals/departures Table ( https://dxp-fds.flughafen-zuerich.ch/flights)
A lot of other API endpoints are charchged and very limited.
